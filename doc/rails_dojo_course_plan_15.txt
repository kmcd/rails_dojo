15:00 Intro to controllers

      --> What are controllers?
      glue
      Action Controller is the C in MVC. After routing has determined which controller to use for a request, your controller is responsible for making sense of the request and producing the appropriate output.
      
      A controller can thus be thought of as a middle man between models and views. It makes the model data available to the view so it can display that data to the user, and it saves or updates data from the user to the model.
      
      --> What is the routes file?
      The Rails router recognizes URLs and dispatches them to a controller’s action. It can also generate paths and URLs, avoiding the need to hardcode strings in your views.

15:05 --> How do you hide the manager pages?
      
      filters
      Filters are methods that are run before, after or “around” a controller action.

      Filters are inherited, so if you set a filter on ApplicationController, it will be run on every controller in your application.

      explination example
      
      before_filter :log
      skip_before_filter

15:10 --> How do you require a password to login

         authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest do |username|
            USERS[username]
         end                                                                 
      end

      Public pages

         session[:logged_in] = true
