15:00 Intro to controllers

      --> What are controllers?
      glue
      Action Controller is the C in MVC. After routing has determined which controller to use for a request, your controller is responsible for making sense of the request and producing the appropriate output.
      
      A controller can thus be thought of as a middle man between models and views. It makes the model data available to the view so it can display that data to the user, and it saves or updates data from the user to the model.
      
      
      --> What is the routes file?
      The Rails router recognizes URLs and dispatches them to a controllerâ€™s action. It can also generate paths and URLs, avoiding the need to hardcode strings in your views.
