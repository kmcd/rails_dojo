11:00 intro to validations (also console)
      --> What are validations ? 
      
      --> Why do you need validations ?
      
      During the normal operation of a Rails application, objects may be
      created, updated, and destroyed. Active Record provides hooks into this
      object life cycle so that you can control your application and its data.

      Validations are used to ensure that only valid data is saved into your
      database. For example, it may be important to your application to ensure
      that every user provides a valid email address and mailing address.
