Time     4 hours
Budget   $50
Deadline 48 hours. (Thursday 5th May)

Here's the landing page I want you to improve: http://railsdojo.heroku.com

Tasks:

1. Typography

Find an elegant font for body, similar to these sites:
- Sans serif: http://workshops.thoughtbot.com/sections/8
- Serif: http://37signals.com/

Also, make h1 color identical to Rails image on right.

2. O'Reilly quote

Add speech bubbles to the quote "Ruby on Rails is a breakthrough ..."

Similar to this quote: http://www.warrender-photography.com/forumphotos/ZZ662933D6.jpg

3. Image border shadow

Add a CSS image border shadow to the 3rd image on the right.

4. Form

- Make "Register Now for Early Bird Discount" stand out. Perhaps using a light 
yellow background and outset box around the form.
- Make the text box & button the width of the div and use a large font
- The submit button should be red (the same color as the h1, rails image & call to action) 

5. Call to action button

Register Now (at the top of the page "If so, Register Now#") should be a large 
button with a red background.

This button is a link to the  "Register Now for Early Bird Discount" form at the
bottom of the page.
