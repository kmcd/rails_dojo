Introduction to Ruby on Rails

= Is Rails any good? / Hook

Do you want to:
   save time and frustration learning Rails ?
   quickly turn your idea into a web app ?
   
If so, learn how in my 1-day, intensive, live-coding training course. 

Ruby on Rails is a breakthrough in lowering the barriers of entry to 
programming. Powerful web applications that formerly might have taken weeks or 
months  to develop can be produced in a matter of days.

Tim O'Reilly, Founder of O'Reilly Media

= Here's what you'll learn

We'll build 2 full-featured apps from start to finish: a Twitter clone and a Reservation system.

Along the way, you'll learn how to:
   Deploy your app to Heroku

All tuition is through live coding. Students are in a line facing a projector with my computer screen. I lead - you follow. Get your questions answered immmediately.
