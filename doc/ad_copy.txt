Introduction to Rails course 

= Is Rails any good? / Hook

Do you want to:
   quickly create apps like Twitter, Basecamp & LinkedIn (all built on Rails)?
   
   work with the best worlds be developers and companies (Forward, Fred George)
   
   join the hottest job market? (Ruby job junt)

I'm a freelance Rails developer and instructor since 2006 - I'll show you how.

Ruby on Rails is a breakthrough in lowering the barriers of entry to 
programming. Powerful web applications that formerly might have taken weeks or 
months  to develop can be produced in a matter of days.
